# The-Legend-of-Zoe
A videogame built for my IFT 1025 - Programming II course. You play Zoe, Zelda's cousin, who must go in search of the 
Hexaforce's pieces to restore order to the world. Zoe advances through the 6 levels of a dungeon, each level hides one of 
the pieces of Hexaforce. Made in collaboration with [Justin Michaud](https://github.com/justinmichaud5)
